## Getting Started

Autonomous Collective DAO is a whitepaper.

1. [Go to]() ...LINK...
2. Connect your [Kukai Wallet](https://wallet.kukai.app/), is supported.

### Deployment

* Contract address [...ADDRESS...](https://better-call.dev/florencenet/KT1Sk3bxiYznre9E9DejbCHHwfWseH47o4PN/)
*on Better Call Dev tezos smart contract explorer*

### What the app should do?

This app allows members of the DAO to fund each other by creating a contract called the "Pact". This pact is between a few members of the DAO. Being part of a Pact obligates each member to pay an agreed upon fee for an agreed upon period of time called a "Cycle".

What do you get by creating a Pact. Each member of the Pact is paid the total Pact value as a lump sum once per Pact. Now some pacts are for high income investments and other pacts are for lower income investments. You can easily find your place by joining a league. Each DAO member joins a league to participate in Pacts. Leagues are deteremined by your spending threshold. Some members can only afford a Pact that cost them $10 dollars a cycle. Other members need a pact that will cost $1,000 dollars a cycle.

Basically each member agrees to pay the League funding requirement every cycle. There is one cycle per member of the specific pact created between those few members. So if three (3) members from the $100 League create a pack with a cycle of two (2) weeks then each person will be paid $300 dollars once a pact. In return they must pay $100 each cycle to the pact contract address.


### Why is this app useful?

Have you ever wanted to invest in a dream but didn't have all the money at the right time? AC DAO is here to the rescue.

1. Connect a Kukai wallet to AC DAO
2. Join a League
3. Pick a Cycle
4. Create a Pact...

It is just that simple
