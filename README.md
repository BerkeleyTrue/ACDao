## Getting Started

Autonomous Collective DAO is a whitepaper.

1. [Go to](https://github.com/Trewaters/ACDao/blob/main/README.md) currently a whitepaper, soon to be a Dapp.
2. Create your [Kukai Wallet](https://wallet.kukai.app/).
3. [Smart contract hash](https://florencenet.tzkt.io/opVMT2DfDJQTNhrAfWcoDuvJAUx3KjjUwANXT2SN3UFXZzSbWun) on testnet (Florencent)

### Deployment

* Contract address [KT1JxYvFxCaf6ouNRnqG8Z1j7BjJfAwMJYcF](https://florencenet.tzkt.io/KT1JxYvFxCaf6ouNRnqG8Z1j7BjJfAwMJYcF/operations/)

### What the app should do?

This app allows members of the DAO to fund each other by creating a contract called the "Pact". Pact are between a few members of the DAO. Being part of a Pact obligates each member to pay an agreed upon fee for an agreed upon period of time called a "Cycle".

What do you get by creating a Pact? Each member of the Pact is paid the total Pact value as a lump sum once per Pact. Each cycle one member is chosen to receive the full Pact value. This distribution started with the most senior member of the Pact and ends on the most junior member of the Pact. A senior member is one who has completed multiple Pacts successfully.

Some Pacts are for high income investors and other Pacts are for lower income investors. You can easily find your place by joining a league. Each DAO member joins a league to participate in Pacts. Leagues are deteremined by your funding threshold. Some members can only afford a Pact that cost $10 dollars a cycle. Other members need a Pact that will cost $1,000 dollars a cycle.

Basically each member agrees to pay the League funding requirement every cycle. There is one (1) cycle per member of the specific Pact created between those few members. So if three (3) members from the $100 League create a Pact with a cycle of two (2) weeks then each member will be paid $300 dollars once a Pact. Each member will pay $100 each cycle to the Pact contract address.

Additional information:

Each member of the DAO must have a twitter account so they can connect their Kukai (web wallet). This requirement adds social proof and pressure to the DAO. This social identity helps fosters community and networking among DAO members.

In order to join a league, and participate in those Pacts, there is a one time 10% fee (fee based on league funding value) per league to join and participate. This fee is used to fund insurance. Insurance is used to pay out fellow Pact members (called "comrades"). Intended as a protection if a comrade becomes hospitalized or dies before all the Pact are completed. If the fund is empty then no insurance is paid out. This is part of our known risks.

Leagues are based on member funding levels. Funding levels are the amounts that members of that league expect to pay for ANY Pacts created in this league. For example a $100 dollar Pact will mean each member MUST pay $100 each cycle to their Pact Comrades.

Cycles is the DAOs way of tracking funding windows. The cycle is agreed on by the Pact Comrades by accepting the Pact terms. Suggested cycles are 2 weeks or 1 month. But comrades can set ANY value they wish, even down to a day. This requirement means that the full term of the Pact is determined by the number of Pact members. For example a three (3) member pact with 1 month cycles will have a Pact term of 3 months total.

Pacts charge a 1% fee (based on league funding level) to all comrades when they are created. Plus each comrade will make a 20% deposit (based on league funding level) to the DAO. This deposit is returned at the end of the Pact term. A comrades deposit will also be used in full to pay missed cycle payments and thus not returned to that comrade at the end of the Pact term.

Penalties or "Strikes" are given when a Comrade fails to pay during the cycle funding window. A member with one (1) strike has all their Pact deposits and fees doubled. The second (2nd) strike will ban that member (kukai wallet address) for life. A member can have strikes removed by paying his debt owed to the comrades plus "Apology" money which I call "Solomon's debt". The member will pay seven (7) times the amount they forfeited. This will be split amongst the Comrades they defaulted on.

### Why is this app useful?

Have you ever wanted to invest in a dream but didn't have all the money at the right time? AC DAO is here to the rescue.

1. Connect a Kukai wallet to AC DAO
2. Join a League
3. Pick a Cycle
4. Create a Pact...

It is just that simple!

Imagine you want to move into a new apartment but you don't have the money for down payment...

Who can come up with all that money at once! 

Now You Can!

By joining a league that is affordable for you based on the cycle you can get that down payment and not break the bank. How? By spending what you can afford each cycle but knowing that you will be paid a large sum on a certain date. You can make big plans based on your pay-out date! Let me give you a concrete example based on moving into an apartment.

EXAMPLE:

Meet Geo, a hard working person like you and I. Geo's lease ends in six (6) months and they want to move into a bigger apartment. The down payment, of $600, on the "bigger" apartment is twice as much Geo's current place. 

Geo starts planning by joining AC DAO!

1. Geo joins a $100 League.
2. Geo finds a Pact with 1 Month Cycles.
3. This pact has 6 members (including Geo).
4. Geo pays $100 a month, for the next six (6) months.
5. Geo is the most junior league member in this pact.
6. On the last cycle Geo is paid $600 dollars by the AC DAO Pact!
7. The Pact is at term so it ends after 6 months. No more funding cycles after all members are paid out.

It is that simple. Get further with Comrades! Join the Autonomous Collective and govern your funds and future dreams. Don't rely on friends, family, or the government to take care of your Financial Independence. Rely on the Pacts you make with Comrades you meet in the AC DAO community!

See you Comrade, where communities prosper and ideas flourish.
